 🎬 YouTube Database Project – Level 2

## 📄 Description – Exercise Statement

This project consists of designing and implementing a simplified SQL relational database that models the core functionality of a YouTube-like platform. The database captures users, channels, videos, tags, playlists, comments, reactions, and subscriptions.

Each user can publish videos, create playlists, comment on content, and interact with others’ content via likes/dislikes. The model supports public, private, and hidden video states, user subscriptions to channels, and many-to-many relationships through linking tables.
